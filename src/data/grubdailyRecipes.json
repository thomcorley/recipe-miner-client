    "introduction": "When I mention fish soup to my friends they typically turn up their noses. I think the first thing that comes to their minds is some kind of unappetising grey-ish slop, but this one is about as far from that image as you could get! This recipe has its roots in Provence, in the south of France. It's a two-day affair; first you have to diligently clean the fish and rinse them under running water before marinating overnight in olive oil, a selection of herbs and spices, and a _mire poix_ of vegetables. This marinating really makes a difference to the depth of flavour - I recommend you don't omit this step. The spices (saffron and paprika) give the soup an inviting golden colour.\r\nIn the restaurant we would order _fish soup mix_ from our fishmonger and they would provide us with a nice range of small fish such as gurnard, mullet, hake or john dory. They were too small to be worth selling on their own as there would be hardly any meat on them, but they were perfect for soup. Luckily I live only a ten minute walk from the harbour, and there is a fishmonger right there on the waterfront. Unfortunately they didn't have any fish-soup-sized fish in stock, so I took one small sea bream and one small sea bass instead.\r\nFor extra savoury punch I begin the soup by frying anchovies to create a sticky, salty base. While the fish are roasting in the oven I add the vegetables to the pan and cook them down until soft and sweet. I also add a tin of cooked sardines. The oily fish gives an extra richness. The amazing thing about this soup is everything is pureed, bones included, to create quite a thick, substantial meal. It's perfect served with black olive tapenade on toast. It really is an amazing dish and I promise that you'll see fish soup in a different light after eating this!",

Superior to lasagne in my opinion, if I had to choose between the two, melanzane  would win hands down. It’s so hot today I have opened all the windows and there is a warm breeze blowing through the room. The weather puts me in the mood for a salad, and thinking about this dish gave me the idea of doing a salad version of it, with crispy aubergine slices, fresh tomatoes and shavings of parmesan. The thought of it has my mouth watering already..",

  "introduction": "I have always been a huge fan of garlic. It’s an awesome ingredient that provides a remarkable amount of flavour given its size… it is small but strong! Obviously it’s more potent when raw, and when used for something like pesto or hummus, you need only a tiny bit. After cooking garlic, however, it loses most of it’s kick and becomes much more mellow. So, if you’re making a pasta sauce for example, you might want a decent amount - 3 or 4 cloves perhaps - to sweat with olive oil for the base of the sauce. Roasting garlic increases the mellowing effect even more, and gives it an amazing deep flavour. This is my favourite way to prepare garlic, and it’s perfect for making soup.",

  "summary": "When you've had a particularly good mushrooming season, this is a fine way to preserve them for enjoyment all year round",
  "total_time": "PT6H",
  "introduction": "I discovered a new woodland paradise for girolles this summer. It's a narrow stretch in the Scottish Borders about two miles long, starting out as a thick pine forest and changing to airy delicate birch further along. There's a path which runs right through the middle of it, and when I approached the birch trees my senses heightened. I knew that girolles and birch are old friends and I was not disappointed: following the line between the edge of the woodland and the path was a seemingly never ending trail of the bright yellow treasures. I filled my basket in no time and had to fashion a knapsack out of my jumper to carry more of them. There were way too many carry! I had to walk back to the car to drop them off and return for a second load. It was getting late, and by the time I'd collected a second load it was starting to get dark. I hadn't even explored the whole wood! There were surely many, many more mushrooms to be found if I just kept walking along that path. It was with a heavy heart that I dragged myself away, promising to myself that I would return the following weekend.\r\nAfter a couple of visits to that wood, I had about 15 kg of girolles. What to do with them? I already wrote about my [experiment with pickling](https://www.grubdaily.com/pickled-girolles), which was a great success. Drying them was a simpler option, at which point I could decide to keep them whole (waiting to be rehydrated with some hot water before adding to a risotto or a pasta sauce), or grinding to a fine powder. I particularly like the latter option: it reduces the girolles to an intensely flavoured general purpose seasoning. You can sprinkle this on pasta or steak to give a kick of flavour, or effortlessly make a delicious sauce by whisking it into boiling cream.\r\nYou can make this with any kind of mushroom, of course. This year was a very successful mushrooming season for me and I now have several jars of different mushroom powders in my cupboard, including girolles, ceps and mousseron. The girolles have a particularly sweet, almost caramel flavour which is just amazing, the ceps are much earthier and pungent. You could also use button mushrooms: although not as tasty as their wild cousins, they will still give you a decent product.",

If it has a lot of grease inside it then your mushroom powder will end up smelling and tasting greasy. Set the oven to 50C, on the fan setting if it has one. Slice the mushrooms into approximately 5mm thick pieces. The more even the thickness of the slices, the more evenly they will dry out. Spread the mushrooms over baking sheets and place in the oven. Make sure the oven is slightly open, to allow the moisture to escape as they dry. My oven has a spring-close door so I wedge a rolled up tea-towel in the top to leave a crack open.",

  "summary": "My favourite way to prepare cockles - in a creamy sauce made from their own cooking liquid.",
  "total_time": "PT1H",
  "introduction": "In my mind, the main reason cockles are so great is not because of the excellent flavour of the actual cockle meat itself – which is very good – but the strong flavoured liquid that results from cooking them. Just like its more glamorous relative the mussel, the cockle contains an abundance of naturally salty juices which are released into the saucepan when cooked. Enhanced with a little white wine, shallots and some aromatics like thyme or bay, the result is fantastic, and served with some chips to dunk in the sauce, is a fine meal in itself.\r\nCockles are also a lovey accompaniment to fish. For this meal, I’ve reduced the liquor from the cockles by half, then added an equal quantity of double cream before reducing further to a fairly light but richly flavoured sauce. I’ve finished it with a nice _chiffonade_ of parsley. The rest of the meal is pretty straight forward; crisp pan-fried cod fillets, and some crushed potatoes with spinach. Wonderful.",

  "introduction": "I just received a slow cooker as a birthday present from my good friend Lewis, its fantastic because it allows me to braise meat and stews for a long time without having to be in the house. When I'm working all day I can have my dinner slowly cooking for when I get back. I make tomato sauce with the slow cooker; tinned tomatoes, onion, garlic, and tomato purée simmered gently for several hours until it is dark and reduced. I then purée and pass it through a fine sieve to make it extra smooth. What you get is an amazingly rich dark red sauce. This can be used for any number of things, but my current favourite is to make salty pungent puttanesca with it. This sauce is accompanied by spaghetti; literally “whore’s style spaghetti”, it’s packed with in-your-face flavours. Traditionally made with tomatoes, garlic, black olives, anchovies and capers, it’s salty and more-ish. It’s a good dish to have in your repertoire; because it’s made almost entirely with store cupboard ingredients it can be rustled up with just a moment’s notice, although in my recipe the tomato sauce is simmered for eight hours to make it extra rich. This isn’t essential but will make your sauce taste amazing. I recommend making a big batch of sauce and freezing it. As there are so many big and bold flavours going on here, I have added a good handful of parsley and basil to bring some freshness to the dish and vital splash of green, making it particularly eye-catching.",

  "total_time": "PT1H30M",
  "introduction": "Lamb chops were always a staple part of our diet when we were young, usually simply roasted and served with baked potatoes and veg from the garden; simple but delicious. The loin meat from the top half of the saddle - the best end - is some of nicest and most tender from the whole animal. Keep the chops attached and you have a rack of lamb, perfect to roast whole and carve into classic lamb cutlets. The bottom half of the saddle - the short saddle - does not have any rib bones and so you would normally just roast this as a piece of loin. What we do in the restaurant is a little more special however; we take the loin from the bone, leaving a flap of the belly fat attached, then make a stuffing from sautéed kidneys and spinach and roll the loin up inside the fat. The saddle is then tied with string and roasted. It’s a lovely way to cook the loin meat as it’s quite well protected from the surrounding fat.",

  "total_time": "PT4H",
  "introduction": "Bolognese sauce in our household was always quite different to what most would consider classic bolognese, which would typically be made with beef and pork. Our sauce would nearly always contain some lamb due to the abundant supply in our freezer. The mince from our own lamb was usually quite fatty and, when mixed in equal parts with lean beef mince, gave a lovely depth of flavour and body to the sauce. It always tasted fantastic; ladled onto a mountain of spaghetti with handfuls of grated parmesan I would devour it with gusto.\r\nLamb bolognese is almost unheard of, which is a shame because it’s so delicious! In my view this is tastier than the classic beef bolognese and I bet that many would agree. Saying that, the recipe I’ve made here is not a plain spag-bol but a modified version, or upgraded, I should say. I made it a little bit creamier than usual, and added extra garlic. A good pile of baby spinach is thrown in and wilted down to tangle with the spaghetti as everything is mixed together. Parmesan cheese is mixed in, along with a splash of the salted starchy pasta water and finally some cherry tomatoes at the very last just to warm through gently. The final sauce is really rich and creamy, with the spinach and tomatoes giving a juiciness that stands up to the strong flavoured lamb.",

  "introduction": "I have become very fond of raw meat. I only recently tried steak tartare, the classic dish of diced raw beef, for the first time and instantly fell in love with it. It is traditionally served with finely chopped shallots, parsley, capers and gherkins, and I have learned that there is some debate about how many extra ingredients to add to the meat. Some like to include condiments such as Worcester sauce, tomato ketchup, mustard, lemon juice and even brandy. One thing is pretty indisputable though, which is that the meat – being the central aspect of the dish – should be of the highest possible quality.\r\nI have had discussions about steak tartare with Alan, fellow Wedgwood chef, who believes that this dish is a pure and simple celebration of meat and should be accompanied by little more than some herbs and seasoning. I appreciate his sentiment and agree that the dish should simple, but I do like to include a couple of extra ingredients…",

  "introduction": "Confit is one of my favourite ways of cooking meat; with something like a duck leg the meat will be amazingly tender and succulent, and the crisp crunchy skin giving a lovely texture contrast. It’s hard not to adore this. Chicken confit is not often heard of, but it's a great way to elevate the humble chicken leg to new tasty new heights. Lemon chicken was something my mum often made when we were young. Simply place some chicken legs in a roasting tray with olive oil, lemons and seasoning and roast in a hot oven until golden and crisp. You get a load of amazingly tasty juices in the tray which are spooned over potatoes or mopped up with crusty bread. One of my favourite ever meals! So this is a new version of that dish; the confit chicken has a superior texture, and the lemon and olive oil dressing is enriched with the jus from the confit and loaded with chopped fresh herbs. For this one, I served it with some sautéed pak choi and buttered new potatoes.",

  "total_time": "PT2H",
  "introduction": "My granny lives on a farm on the west coast of Scotland near Oban, right by the sea where it’s windswept and wild. The best bit about going to visit is that you get treated to her home-made bread. She makes beautiful wholegrain rolls with seeds in and treacle to make them extra dark, rich and malty. They’re the tastiest, nourishing things you could imagine. She used to make them with normal wheat flour, but in recent years she found that she has an intolerance to wheat gluten so she uses spelt flour now instead.\r\nSpelt is brilliant. It’s an ancestor of wheat that has been used for around 9000 years. It was an important crop in the development of civilisation because it thrived in poor growing conditions and was particularly resistant to disease and pests due the tough outer husk surrounding the grain. More recently it's become redundant as preference has moved to higher-yielding varieties of wheat that are better suited to the commercial bread industry.\r\nYou can still can buy spelt from some health food shops and delicatessens, which is good news because it's absolutely delicious. As well as making bread with the flour you can make excellent risotto from whole spelt grains, as they do in a number of restaurants now. My granny doesn’t knead the dough at all, which gives a pleasing rustic consistency to the bread. She also uses fairly hot water to activate the yeast; the water shouldn’t be too hot, as this would kill the yeast, but just hand-hot (about 45C). This relatively high temperature causes the bread to rise quickly, resulting in lots of little air pockets. Her technique for baking the bread is to simply bake all of the dough into one large flat loaf, then cut it up into roll-sized portions once it has cooled. If you prefer, you could shape into individual rolls and bake them separately.",

  "title": "Hearty's Stuffed Rabbit Saddle",
  "summary": "This is a beautiful way to prepare a rabbit saddle",
  "total_time": "PT3H",
  "introduction": "My flatmate Hearty and I went through the wars together when we worked at The Kitchin, an invaluable experience that both toughened us and taught us how to _really_ cook properly. I have fond memories of those days. Although I left the chef game a few years ago, Hearty is still working in restaurants and due to this pandemic he has, unsurprisingly, had a lot of spare time on his hands recently. If that means he has more time to cook delicious meals we can share together, then that's got to be a silver lining!\r\nThere had been a couple of rabbit saddles in our freezer for several months, which Hearty had brought home from work. He took them out last week and decided to put them to good use. This dish is more restaurant-style than what you would typically find on this blog – it's elegant and beautiful and would not be out of place on the menu of a Michelin star restaurant. The carved cross-section of the stuffed rabbit saddle makes it a particularly eye-catching dish.\r\nHearty and I are both very much at home deboning and stuffing rabbit saddles, as we both worked on the meat section at The Kitchin and rabbit was a regular feature of the menu there. Back then we used to cut the saddle in half and stuff a single loin, wrapped in its belly flap and tied with string, whereas this time Hearty kept the whole saddle in one piece, carefully removing the bone with the skin still intact all around both loins. It's a delicate operation that requires finesse. If you ask your butcher, they may be able to do this for you. You'll need some butcher's string, too, for tying it up. Tying the saddle with a proper butcher's knot is a skill in itself. I'm not going to attempt to provide instructions for this, but you can easily find videos on YouTube to help you. Also, you should ideally have an ovenproof heavy-based frying pan or skillet for cooking the rabbit saddle.",

Place a large heavy-based pan over a high heat and add about 2 tablespoons of rapeseed oil. When the oil is hot (after about 30 seconds), add the chopped rabbit bones and fry, stirring occasionally, until they are a golden colour. Remove the bones from the pan and set aside. Now add the carrots, celery, onion, garlic thyme and bay. Add a pinch of salt, then cook for about 5 minutes until the vegetables have softened and any caramelised residue on the bottom of the pan has become unstuck. Add the brandy, and boil until reduced to a syrupy consistency. Add enough water to cover the bones, and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 2 hours, topping up with water when necessary to ensure the bones are covered. Strain the sauce through a fine sieve into another pan, add the cream, then boil until reduced to a thick sauce consistency. Finally, stir in the mustard.",

  "introduction": "One of the desserts we serve at Wedgwood is a marmalade on toast crème brûlée; it has a layer of marmalade in the bottom of the ramekin and then a toast-infused cream that is set on top. It tastes fantastic. This is basically a peanut flavoured custard set into a ramekin on top of some jam. To ‘brûlée’ a normal crème brûlée, sugar is sprinkled on top and then caramelised with a blow torch or by grilling. Tony, one of the Wedgwood chefs, suggested sprinkling on some toasted crushed peanuts at the end to create extra crunch, which I thought was a great idea. I decided to use salted peanuts, as the peanut butter contains salt anyway and it gives a nice contrast to the sweet cream and jam.",

  "summary": "An simple and delicious salad made with one of the most delicious fish around",
  "total_time": "PT20M",
  "introduction": "When this lockdown started, almost 2 months ago, everyone rushed to the supermarkets and started panic-buying. There was virtually nothing left on the shelves, and sundry items like pasta, rice, flour and tinned-goods were completely sold out. It was like a weird version of Christmas eve, where instead of brussel sprouts and parsnips being sold out, it was tinned tomatoes and tinned fish. And it lasted for 2 weeks! Now the supermarkets have recovered from that crazy period of panic-buying, things are available on the shelves again, and although the situation is far from being normal, at least we can buy the ingredients we need.\r\nI wanted to write some recipes for this lockdown, using ingredients that people are likely to have in the house and don't have to make a special trip to the shop for. I had the idea of making a 'what to eat in an apocalypse' series of posts, using only store-cupboard ingredients. The reality is, I think most people are managing to get to the shops at least once per week and nearly all the produce you want is available. If you're organised, you can still eat a meal every day made with a nice variety of fresh produce. Nevertheless, it's nice to find a theme and go with it.\r\nSo, you might be surprised to hear that I've been eating a lot of tinned mackerel recently. Not out of necessity, just because I discovered some fine quality tinned mackerel that is basically just a smoked mackerel fillet, cut in half, marinated in olive oil. The fish has been salted to cure it before smoking, too, which makes it a perfect product to be preserved in this way – not unlike marinated artichokes or sun-dried tomatoes. It would be just fine to eat on its own, which I do on occasion, but it also combines with some shredded red cabbage, torn basil and chopped lemon to make an excellent salad.",

It’s a rustic French classic that is hard to beat as a crowd pleaser; a perfect marriage of ingredients that seem destined to accompany one another. Who could fail to adore this? Although these days it’s usually made with chicken (as I did), a traditional coq au vin is made with a mature cockerel. The meat from such a bird will be dark and rich in flavour compared to a young hen, but correspondingly tough as a result, meaning that it needs to be braised gently for a long time to make it tender. So I was looking forward to some tasty chicken slowly cooked in red wine&#8230; and to complete this classic dish, simply add small button mushrooms, baby pearl onions and some chunky dice of pancetta. Simply wonderful.",

  "summary": "Although not as famous as its steak-counterpart, this salmon tartare is really delicious",
  "total_time": "PT20M",
  "introduction": "I haven’t got one single post about fish on this blog yet, which is a shame because I’ve been living in Edinburgh for a while now and, being in Scotland and situated right next to the sea, it’s obviously a great place for eating seafood. I admit that I’m a bit of a novice when it comes to fish as I don’t often cook it, although I do love eating it.\r\nI recently invested in a copy of the River Cottage Fish Book which has provided a good bit of inspiration. Flicking through it the other day, a photo of salmon tartare grabbed my attention. Since making steak tartare recently and appreciating its beautiful simplicity, salmon tartare obviously appealed to me. Steak tartare is a celebration of well-aged, tender beef that is full of flavour. Salmon tartare is much the same: the piece of fish used must be top quality and as fresh as possible. Finding such a piece of fish was not going to be a problem in Edinburgh, and was particularly easy for me as Armstrong’s fishmongers, recognised by many as the best in the city, happens to be just down the road from my flat. “All of this was fresh this morning” he assured me when I told him I needed a piece of salmon as fresh as possible. On slicing it was clearly very fresh, the orange-pink flesh glossy and firm. Tasting it as it was, pure and unadorned, it already had excellent flavour.\r\nHugh Fearnley Whittingstall uses Tabasco and Worcester sauce in his recipe which I chose to omit here as I think the amazing flavour of the fish shouldn’t be masked too much by additives. My version of the dish, I believe, includes enough extra ingredients to compliment and enhance the natural flavour of the fish without overpowering it. One of my favourite things about this dish is the magic worked by the lemon juice. As well as imparting sharp fresh flavour, the acid in the lemon juice affects the protein in the fish, causing a “cooked” texture on the surface of the meat. The acid denatures the protein molecules just as heat does when cooking, and as the brine did in my pig’s cheeks recipe. Pickling things in vinegar, again, has the same denaturing effect. All of these in a sense are just different ways of cooking meat. The advantage of using a method like this is that the fresh flavour of the raw meat does not change nearly as much as if you cooked it. The salmon will continue to “cook” for as long as it is left to marinate in the lemon juice. I would recommend no more than 5 minutes; this will result in a fairly thin layer of cooked-texture meat surrounding a lovely soft rare centre.",

The process of salting and smoking fish was originally a method of preserving the fish to enable long storage.

I recently had great pleasure in making Cullen Skink - the traditional Scottish soup made with smoked haddock - but since it has been so warm recently I wanted to do something a bit less hearty and filling. Some sort of salad seemed like the best thing to do, so I just warmed the fish gently in some milk, and flaked it over a simple salad of baby spinach, spring onions and courgette sliced thinly into ribbons. Topped finally with a poached egg, simple but delicious.",

  "introduction": "The secret to any great loaf of bread is a pre-ferment, or _starter_. A starter provides a depth of flavour to the bread, but, arguably more important, it gives it a fantastic texture. This is due to the fact that a mature sourdough has had plenty of time to develop a complex gluten network over a period of several weeks (or months, or years!), which is simply unattainable with a standard loaf that's only proved for a few hours.\r\n\r\nThis sourdough starter will take at least five days to make, but from that point it'll last indefinitely, provided you look after it. After five days, you'll be able to make a decent loaf of bread with it, but if you leave it for longer; two or three weeks, say, you'll get an even better flavour and texture.\r\n\r\nThis is a true wild yeast; an actual living organism. I think there's something amazing about being able to extract this stuff from thin air, literally. I've talked about my love for sourdough in a [previous blog post](https://www.grubdaily.com/posts/sourdough), and I thought it would be worth sharing a recipe for the starter here. The recipe here is copied almost verbatim from James Morton's [Super Sourdough](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Super-Sourdough-foolproof-making-world-class/dp/1787134652/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=super+sourdough&qid=1611693793&sr=8-1), which in my opinion is the best sourdough book money can buy.",

Don't add more flour during this time. Ignore any bubbles that appear in the first couple of days – these are caused by an early bacterial fermentation that is no good for making bread with. Just stir away the bubbles then leave it. On roughly the fifth or sixth day (but it might be anything from the fourth to the seventh) you'll notice a distinct rise in the number of bubbles and a big jump in the volume of your starter. Now we can start on the next phase. If you don't notice this increase after a full week has passed, or it turns **black** or **pink** or **blue** or notice a strong unpleasant smell, dump it and begin again.",

If you keep it at room temperature you will need to feed it every day; if you keep it in the fridge you should feed it once per week to keep it active, but it can survive for several weeks between feeds. Once your starter has made its big jump in volume, don't feed it straight away. Let it get used to this new environment; let the bugs grow. When you notice the walls of the bubbles begin to collapse or the volume start to diminish, that's when you can be confident that you've got as much yeast as you're going to get and you can feed it. Add equal weights of rye flour and water to your starter, and mix. Wait for 12 hours. Your starter is now ready. As a rule, it should be fed in proportions similar to those aforementioned (100g each of flour and water), – the **new total weight** of starter should be at least **double** to that prior to feeding.",

Its bubble-like texture is beautiful, too, and makes for an eye-catching plate of food.\r\nI've boosted the cavolo's natural savouriness by pairing it with Parmesan cheese, one of the world's most famous sources of umami. The fact that they are two classic Italian ingredients makes this dish all the more satisfying. The cavolo nero is prepared in 3 different ways; steamed, finely chopped raw and roasted. The full range of flavour is maximised from this amazing vegetable. A selection of nuts adds to the savouriness and adds some extra texture. To counter the bold flavours and ensure that things don't get too rich, I've added some finely sliced celery and a fresh tarragon vinegar dressing.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "introduction": "Macaroni cheese is a classic home-made dish for me. It was a firm favourite for my siblings and I at home especially for my brother who would devour mountains of it with lashings of tomato ketchup. We were so particular about the consistency of the sauce, being adamant that it had to be “nice and sloppy”. These days I like it a little thicker but still loose enough to be gooey and tempting, and with a nice crunchy gratin on top to give contrast in texture. One thing my parents did was to put slices of tomato on the top among the cheese. As a big fan of tomatoes, I would highly advise this. It gives a light freshness to balance the weight of all that cheese. The quality of a macaroni can be judged by the quality of its cheese sauce. My Dad taught me how to make perfectly smooth cheese sauce (or white sauce); he told me to add the milk to the roux in stages, and stir thoroughly each time to ensure that its totally smooth before adding more. It’s completely fail-safe and I’ve never made a lumpy cheese sauce since.",

There are two things I generally prefer to do with a pork belly; either salt it and cure it to make dry-cured bacon, or braise it long and slow, for about 12 hours, then press and chill it before roasting it until crispy. Pork belly cooked this way has the most amazing mouthfeel; the meat itself is succulent and has fat running through the layers that melts in your mouth, and the skin that sits atop is the most fantastic crisp pork crackling. It’s a great contrast of textures!",

  "total_time": "PT4H",
  "introduction": "One of the old school _forgotten vegetables_, the jerusalem artichoke is one of my favourites. Roasting them until they're crisp and caramelised, almost blackened, brings out the sweetness in this humble root, and it just happens to go really well with some homemade ricotta, made soft by mixing some of the whey back into it, and a generous glug of best quality extra virgin olive oil. It's excellent served simply with some nice bread.\r\nThe method for making the ricotta is exactly the same as my [existing recipe](https://www.grubdaily.com/ricotta). You will need muslin (cheesecloth) or a clean tea-towel to strain the cheese.",

Now place the tray in the oven and roast for about 40 minutes, tossing a couple of times, until they're dark and caramelised. It might take longer, depending on your oven.",

  "summary": "A classic from my childhood",
  "total_time": "PT1H",
  "introduction": "This soup is extremely popular in our household, and one of the first recipes I learned off by heart. Probably closer to minestrone than tomato, It’s thick and hearty, guaranteed to fill you up. Instead of pasta, as in a typical minestrone, this soup has a handful of rice thrown in the beginning which swells up to thicken the liquid and give it some body. You could use lentils instead, if you prefer. This is a chunky, broth-like soup rather than being smooth and silky, and although I like to cut all the vegetables to a nice uniform shape and size, you can cut them any old way and be as rustic as you like. As with many soups, the quality of this one comes down to the stock. I will usually make this soup after cooking a joint of smoked gammon or bacon, using the delicious salty liquid as the meaty backbone for my tomatoey broth. I highly advise this, if not then some nice vegetable stock is an acceptable alternative. This soup is best enjoyed with freshly baked bread and butter. As for us, we were treated to Dad’s crusty baguettes, still piping hot from the oven",

It's flavoured -and coloured- with annatto seeds; they have a distinctive, slightly sharp flavour and a deep red colour, as you can see from the photos. This is an uncompromising meal. When you eat, it rampages down your throat. When I first made it, 'twas was like nothing I had ever tasted before and it remains one of the most unique flavours I have ever encountered. It's not just the heat from the chilli, its the combination of that along with the vinegary tang and the distinctive flavour of annatto which makes it. You have to try it.",

  "introduction": "This is a deeply savoury, and surprisingly sweet, recipe to make the most of a glut of chanterelles (a.ka. _girolles_). It's approaching the end of the season for my favourite yellow fungi, which is somewhat sad, but I've had a few decent hauls on my various outings to the woods, and I've got plenty of mushrooms preserved and stored away to keep me going throughout the year.\r\nTo properly capitalise on the flavour of the mushrooms, I sauté them in a separate pan in butter and finish with _persilllade_ (finely chopped garlic and parsley) before adding them, along with their delicious cooking liquor, to the curry to simmer for a short while.",

Next, cut the larger of your mushrooms in two to make them all approximately the same size. Now place a large, heavy-based pan or casserole dish over a medium-high heat and wait for it to get hot. Add the butter, and when it starts to foam, add the mushrooms along with a generous two-fingers-and-thumb pinch of sea salt. Do not overcrowd the pan – the mushrooms should be approximately in a single layer. Do them in batches if need be. Stir-and-fry the mushrooms for 30 seconds, then add the persillade (also in correspondingly sized batches if you're cooking the mushrooms in batches). Cook for 30 seconds more, then add a small glassful of water. Place a lid (or a piece of kitchen foil or greaseproof paper) over the pan. Cook for 2 - 3 minutes at medium-high heat, until the mushrooms are tender. Strain the mushrooms, reserving the liquid. Transfer the liquid back into the pan and bring to the boil.

  "introduction": "The Bouchon collection is a set of recipe books by one of my idols; Thomas Keller of The French Laundry. Bouchon is the three Michelin starred chef’s bistro in Yountville, California that serves French classics like beef bourguignon, salt cod brandade, and quiche. There is a chapter on the quiche where Keller talks about the lost art of making great quiche; something which seems to have gone out of fashion, or forgotten about. A proper quiche will be two inches deep, filled to the very brim with a barely set, perfectly light custard. The shortcrust pastry should be rich and crisp, and specifically 4-5mm thick, so that it remains crisp and doesn’t become soggy after cooking. I had a couple of attempts at this quiche before getting a satisfactory result, and I was pleased with my third try. I actually bought a 9″ quiche ring especially for the task as none of the pastry rings in my house were quite the right size. One of the brilliant things about this recipe is the lightness of the custard; Keller blitzes the custard mix in a blender before pouring into the pastry shell, aerating the mix and resulting in a delicate light filling. This recipe is more or less the same as that found in Bouchon, but I’ve added spinach to the filling and converted the ingredients from pounds and ounces to kilograms.",

  "summary": "This is my favourite dish to make with button mushrooms",
  "total_time": "PT9H",
  "introduction": "I have long been an advocate of the humble button mushroom. It’s one of these ingredients that’s so commonplace, I reckon it’s not appreciated to its full potential. A staple in your greasy breakfast fry-up, or as a mediocre ‘cream of mushroom soup’, the button mushroom is actually so much better that you might realise. They are high in umami – the taste that makes things savory – and they have a lot of powerful flavour locked inside. One of their characteristics is that they have an extremely high water content, making the flavour rather bland until you have reduced the moisture. I’ve also found that when you fry them in a hot pan with a pinch of salt until they’re dark and caramelised, the flavour is amazingly intense and savory. This is what gave me the idea of doing a roast mushroom soup. It’d be better than the average mushroom soup as it would be a rich golden colour, instead of grey, and the resulting flavour would be all the more powerful.",

  "title": "Tomato and Sorrel Salad",
  "summary": "Common sorrel is abundant in the summer fields, and it goes well with tomatoes to make a refreshing salad",
  "total_time": "PT20M",
  "introduction": "The bounty of summer is here. On my daily walks around the network of cycle paths near my house, there is a glut of various edible delights. Nettles and elderflowers are particularly abundant at the moment, and there are heaps of bramble bushes that are flowering. I can't wait until they start bearing fruit in a couple of months time. Last week I went a little further afield to a favourite local wood where I reliably find girolle mushrooms every year. I was a bit too optimistic, as there were not yet any girolles to be found, but I did find sorrel, both the woodland and common variety. Sorrel has a delicate citrus flavour, and is typically served with fish. In the restaurant I used to work in, we only ever used wood sorrel, its tiny and pretty clover-shaped leaves being perfect as a finishing touch for many different dishes. Common sorrel is, although not as pretty to look at, just as nice and citrusy and the leaves can grow to be much larger than its woodland relative. This makes it a better candidate for being a main player in a dish rather than just a passive decoration. The lemony-ness of sorrel goes quite well with tomatoes, to make an excellent summer salad.\r\nThis is the easiest recipe ever. I randomly cut the tomatoes, seasoned with sea salt, then made a really simple herb dressing with the sorrel and some oil (using neutral-flavoured sunflower oil instead of olive oil so as not to overpower the delicate flavour of the sorrel), and drizzled it over the tomatoes, finishing with some whole sorrel (both varieties) as decoration.",

Spaghetti carbonara is still my favourite meal of all time – I don't think I will ever grow tired of it. My more recent changes include a reduction in the amount of egg; I now include one whole egg per person which, when combined with the starchy pasta water and a knob of butter, makes for a beautiful silky sauce.\r\nThis dish is Italian cooking at its best; simple, quick and with an emphasis on quality ingredients. It can be deceptively tricky to perfect however; too much heat when adding the eggs can result in scrambling them instead of gently cooking them to get the desired silky smooth sauce.  If you can, get a hold of some good quality spaghetti that's been made with a bronze die, as it'll hold the sauce much better.",

  "title": "Cured Chicken Leg with Butter Beans",
  "summary": "This is currently my favourite way to prepare a chicken leg.",
  "total_time": "PT9H",
  "introduction": "This is a great way to cook a chicken leg that gets the best out of the skin by exploiting its crispy crunchy potential. I'm sure most of you will agree when I say the best part of a chicken is the crispy skin. The secret here is to lightly cure the chicken skin by sprinkling rock salt on it and leaving for about 8 hours. This draws moisture out of the skin, meaning that it goes amazingly crispy when you fry it, much the same as a confit duck leg. I make a simple spice rub with some olive oil, garlic and paprika and rub this into the flesh side. The result is fantastic.\r\nThe butter bean stew is rustic and unfussy, reminiscent of a French cassoulet or a Spanish white bean stew. I've finished it with some fresh basil leaves and a drizzle of olive oil. Add a bottle of fresh white wine and you've got a perfect summer's evening meal.\r\nYou'll need to bone out the chicken leg, ideally with the skin intact, with no holes. It requires a bit of finesse. Alternatively, you could just use thighs instead, which are much easier.",

    "description": "For the chicken, it's a good idea to remove it from the fridge to wash the salt off and dry it about 30 minutes before you cook it. This will ensure the skin is really dry and ready to go, and it'll also bring the meat up to temperature a bit, allowing for more even cooking. Wash the salt from the skin side of the chicken under a running tap, being careful not to wash off the paprika on the other side. Take some kitchen paper and pat the skin as dry as you can get it.",

  "introduction": "Winter is coming and the time for hearty and warming stews topped with delicious golden crisp pastry is near. Pies! My mouth is watering at just the thought. I already wrote about pies when I did a series of posts on classic home cooking, namely my delicious steak pie and shepherd’s pie but I really felt that chicken pie needed to be added to the collection since this meat is so popular. I was thrifty with this dish, wasting nothing, as one always should when eating meat. I took one small bird and got maximum use from it, roasting the meat on the bone then using the carcass to make some stock. I then reduced this down to intensify the flavour and enriched it with sherry and a little beurre manié to make the gravy for the pie. This dish will take most of the day to cook, but I make no apologies for this. I hate to compromise flavour for the sake of saving time. In any case, there are few things that I enjoy more than spending all afternoon in the kitchen creating something delicious. I served it with some leeks sautéed in butter, and it was fantastic.",

  "introduction": "I was clearing out my fridge a few weeks ago and came across a selection of root vegetables lurking there, waiting to be turned into something tasty. The first thing that came to my mind was soup, and since we were in the middle of winter I was thinking along the lines of a chunky, meaty broth. I decided on Chicken, which would provide my soup with both the chunky meat component and the stock. A bunch of fresh coriander which also happened to be in my fridge could be involved here in some way, I thought. I remembered a Madhur Jaffrey recipe for coriander chicken curry, involving large quantities of fresh coriander, resulting in a vibrant green curry sauce. It was fantastic, and so I reckoned it could work in my soup too. The earthiness of all those root vegetables would be balanced by the fresh zing of the coriander, perhaps. I prepared the chicken in my usual way; removed the breasts, then cut up the remaining carcass into small pieces and fried until nicely caramelised for the stock. This time I actually chopped up the wings and legs too and added them to the stock for extra flavour. Once the stock was almost ready, after an hour or so, I took some out to gently poach the breast meat in a separate pan. Once perfectly barely cooked, I allowed them to cool before carefully cutting them into dice. All the vegetables and chicken diced to the same size, making for an attractive looking bowl of broth.",

  "title": "Super Spicy Kimchi",
  "summary": "My favourite way to prepare cabbage, and probably the best fermented food product in the world.",
  "total_time": "PT5D1H",
  "introduction": "Kimchi is a Korean classic and, along with its German cousin _saukraut_, is one of the world's most well-known fermented foods. It's no coincidence that they're both made from cabbage; there's something about this humble vegetable that makes it particularly delicious when lacto-fermented - it's really, really savory.\r\nKimchi comprises a number of things that I have a great fondness for: garlic, ginger, chillies and salt. The combination of these powerful ingredients, along with the fermentation process, results in a very potent flavour. Obviously I wanted to try making my own kimchi and put my own slant on this classic, and after doing some research I ended up constructing a hybrid of a few different recipes. My variation was to add a bit more garlic and ginger and _a lot_ more chillies. Most recipes for classic kimchi call for _gochugaru_ chilli flakes, which are a vibrant red colour. I opted for _ancho_, which are a dark, almost black colour and more sweet than spicy, and _arbol_, which are a brighter red colour and are fairly spicy. The result was a darker, earthier colour which I think is much nicer and more appetising than the classic bright red version. My version is also considerably spicier than your average shop-bought kimchi, which is what makes it better in my opinion. But I'm a chilli addict, so maybe I'm biased.\r\nFor this recipe you'll need 3-4 large jam jars or Kilner jars. You should get a lovely earthy color if you use the same chilli flakes (although the colour will fade a bit compared to the photo, as it was taken at the start of the fermentation process), but if you can't source the ancho and arbol chilli flakes, just use whatever you can find.",

  "summary": "Wood blewits are a very special mushroom and this is a wonderful way to prepare them.",
  "total_time": "PT1H30M",
  "introduction": "As a lifelong lover of mushrooms, I was disappointed with myself that I only recently became acquainted with wood blewits. They have a distinctive purple hue to them that is quite eye-catching and if you didn't know they were edible you'd probably leave them well alone for fear of being poisoned! They're not poisonous though of course, they're definitely edible and have a distinctive, unique flavour that's hard to describe. I think they have a slightly floral character a little bit like lavender; my dad describes the flavour as 'purple'. That sounds nonsensical but, honestly I have to agree with him, 'purple' is probably the best way to describe this flavour and I don't think you have to be a synesthesiac to appreciate that!\r\nDeciding what best to pair the wood blewits with was not particularly straightforward. Unlike most of the other more well known varieties of mushrooms, the blewits lack that typical earthiness that makes a mushroom go so well with strong savoury or meaty flavours. The floral notes of the wood blewits made me think fish might be a good pairing instead of meat. If the fish was gently steamed and then finished with a drizzle of fine quality olive oil then I reckoned that would be a perfect compliment to the delicacy of the mushroom's flavour. I then capitalised on the purpleness by adding purple potatoes to make a strikingly attractive ragout. It turned out to be excellent and I will most definitely be making this next year when the blewits come into season again.\r\nYou will need a steamer for this recipe. You can probably get a nice quality bamboo one from your local Chinese supermarket, or order one online. Make sure you get one that's big enough to fit all of your portions of fish in a single layer, with enough space for some gaps between them.",

  "introduction": "I have become quite fond of black beans. I’ve starting substituting them for kidney beans in chilli con carne, fajitas and other Mexican favourites. Also, one of my favourite Madhur Jaffrey recipes is a South African red kidney bean curry; it’s a simple but amazingly delicious recipe that impresses me every time I make it. I tried making it with black beans instead of kidney beans and it was even better! I’m not sure exactly what it is about black beans that makes me like them so much. I suspect it may have something to do with the fact that my favourite meal from my local Chinese restaurant is _beef and black bean sauce_. For this dish, I think they ferment the black beans which makes them extra flavorsome. Fermented or not, I believe black beans actually have a deeper, more savory flavour than most other beans.\r\nThis recipe is a really simple, easy dish that’s perfect as a weekend breakfast or brunch. Nothing more than onion, garlic and some cumin accompany the stewed beans; and to top the egg I have scattered over some rustic chopped coriander and a squeeze of lime. I like to fry the egg until it’s golden and crispy around the edges.\r\nIt’s a fairly quick recipe; only about 50 minutes of cooking time, however, remember to soak your beans overnight first.",

This dal, made from black _urid beans_ however, is a bit more special. Due to the toughness of these beans, they must be soaked for several hours, then slowly simmered over a gentle heat for several hours more. Of course, a customary mixture of garlic, onion and spices is added to the mixture, and the result is a dark earthy bean stew that has a hint of smokiness. It's very rich, there's no denying it, so I have finished it with a swirl of yoghurt and some freshly chopped coriander.",

  "total_time": "PT1H20M",
  "introduction": "My friend Adel recently sourced some lovely short grain brown rice from one of her local shops, and it's so delicious. We made a curry and accompanied it with the brown rice, baked in the oven like a _pilaf_, and it was just perfect. The little grains have such a nice texture and an earthy, almost nutty flavour. It occurred to me at that moment that this rice would be perfect for a mushroom risotto.\r\nThe other half of this recipe presented itself after I recently returned from a day out walking through the forests in the Scottish borders with a huge amount of girolle mushrooms. The mushroom season is in full swing here, and you can get almost anything you want if you know where to look. If you can't get a hold of any wild mushrooms, you could still make a nice version of this recipe with regular button mushrooms or chestnut mushrooms.",

It&#8217;s a proper hearty winter warmer of a dish, and pretty much a meal in itself as it is so thick and substantial. I made this soup with meat from the braised breast and stock that I made from the mutton bones. You could instead use leftover meat from a mutton or lamb roast, along with chicken stock from powder if you don&#8217;t want to make stock from scratch. The mutton could also be substituted quite satisfactorily with chicken; get some chicken thighs, season and toss in olive oil and roast on gas mark 7 for about 30 minutes. Then just pick off the meat and substitute into the recipe below accordingly. I used braised breast, but you could just as well use another cut such as scruffy chops, belly or neck chops. If you do braise some meat, you could use the braising liquor instead of making stock, although it will taste quite strongly of wine (if you use my recipe below) which you may not want in the soup. I believe the rich mellow flavour obtained from the slowly cooked stock is preferable in this case.",

  "introduction": "I often think that I’m very lucky to have grown up on a sheep farm, as I have a reliable supply of delicious organic lamb to create tasty delights with on a regular basis. I received a delivery of half a lamb a few weeks ago to replenish my supply. All of a sudden the drawers of the freezer were happily jammed and stuffed with shoulder, leg, neck and countless chops. If I was forced to choose I would probably have to pick lamb as my favourite meat, which may seem surprising given that throughout my childhood I was nurtured and brought up on it; far from being sick of it though, I think I have a greater appreciation of good quality meat from well raised animals.\r\nMy home county, Northumberland, produces more lamb than any in the country, and some of the most delicious lamb and mutton in the world is from there. I hate to see lamb from New Zealand on the supermarket shelves when we have much better tasting stuff right here on our doorstep. The tastiest I’ve ever had was from the farm back home, and I reckon this meat is the best to be found anywhere.This is from Raymond Blanc’s Kitchen Secrets, another reliable recipe which his mother, the legendary “Maman Blanc” would have made. Rustic home cooking. It’s lamb shoulder, slow-roasted to achieve a gorgeous melting texture, and with some bones and neck chops in the bottom of the pan along with wine and herbs creating an extremely flavoursome liquid to make the sauce with. For this I reduced the liquid slightly, thickened with some beurre manié and stirred in some finely chopped mint and a splash of white wine vinegar. I served the lamb with some leek and carrot, finely sliced to mirror the flakiness of the meat, and some roasted new potatoes.",

I added some sauteed girolles with persillade to give a savoury contrast to the vinegary tang of the pickled ones. Along with some wilted greens, crisp baby gem hearts and some shallot rings, it was a fine combination.\r\nI used wilted chard as a base; I spread out a couple of the large green leaves on the plate to create a vibrant platform for the rest of the salad. You can use any greens you like however – spinach, kale, or whatever you can get. The heart of the baby gem lettuce is an important part of this dish as it provides texture.

  "introduction": "When I was younger I always preferred savoury food over sweet, but since working in restaurants and learning to make proper desserts I have come to have a greater appreciation for them. In expanding my culinary repertoire I will embrace all types of food equally, both sweet and savoury! Tarte Tatin is a dessert that we used to do for lunch at Wedgwood; it’s a classic French dish, delicious and quite easy to make. As with a lot of food I love, I really appreciate the simplicity of it. The combination of rich sweet caramel and tart apples is balanced beautifully by the smoothness from the butter; these are flavours that were made for each other.\r\nIt’s the prime season for apples right now so this is a good time to make it. I’ve never tried making puff pastry from scratch before, as I know it’s a time consuming process, but I’d like to do it some time. I’ll put a recipe up on here when I do, but for now I’m just using ready-rolled pastry from the shop which is of pretty good quality anyway and saves a lot of time. Just four ingredients make up this amazing dessert: apples, sugar, butter and puff pastry. As for the apples, a tart eating variety is needed – I recommend Cox as the best option as they have a great flavour and also hold their shape well when cooked instead of turning mushy. Since it’s such a simple dish, the quality of each individual ingredient is more important so I would suggest getting a block of some really nice expensive butter for this. Desserts are a luxury anyway so you might as well do it properly!",

  "total_time": "PT2H",
  "introduction": "Years ago my friend Cecily showed me how to make risotto, she was so enthusiastic about the merits of this dish and was amazed that I’d never made it before! It was the start of a beautiful relationship with this Italian classic; now a staple in my repertoire, I must have made hundreds of risottos, including a few variations…barley is a nice alternative to rice and perfect to serve with chicken. We feed barley to the hens on the farm, so this seems like an apt combination for a dish.\r\nA benefit of using barley instead of rice is that it’s considerably more difficult to overcook. Also the grains give a lovely bursting sensation when you chew them which is fantastic. Firstly, I like to caramelise some finely diced pancetta or home-cured bacon to release some vital fat and get an amazing flavour base before adding finely chopped onion to sweat down slowly and gently. I will sweat the onion for a good fifteen minutes before adding anything else, making sure they become soft and sweet. To add some extra flavour and a nice touch of colour, I cooked some carrot dice and some baby button mushrooms in a separate pan to be stirred into the risotto at the very end, along with a generous handful of chopped herbs.",

  "introduction": "I was clearing out my fridge a few weeks ago and came across a selection of root vegetables lurking there, waiting to be turned into something tasty. The first thing that came to my mind was soup, and since we were in the middle of winter I was thinking along the lines of a chunky, meaty broth. I decided on Chicken, which would provide my soup with both the chunky meat component and the stock. A bunch of fresh coriander which also happened to be in my fridge could be involved here in some way, I thought. I remembered a Madhur Jaffrey recipe for coriander chicken curry, involving large quantities of fresh coriander, resulting in a vibrant green curry sauce. It was fantastic, and so I reckoned it could work in my soup too. The earthiness of all those root vegetables would be balanced by the fresh zing of the coriander.\r\nI prepared the chicken in my usual way; removed the breasts, then cut up the remaining carcass into small pieces and fried until nicely caramelised for the stock. This time I actually chopped up the wings and legs too and added them to the stock for extra flavour. Once the stock was almost ready, after an hour or so, I took some out to gently poach the breast meat in a separate pan. Once perfectly barely cooked, I allowed them to cool before carefully cutting them into dice. All the vegetables and chicken diced to the same size, making for an attractive looking bowl of broth.",

It’s a really nice way to prepare chicken, and pretty easy too. I like chicken legs because they have so much more flavour than the breast meat, and by removing the bones and sinew they become an effortless pleasure to eat. The great thing about this dish is when you slice the chicken leg you see the beautiful glistening cross-section of the muscle, outlined by the crispy pancetta. I served it with sautéed button mushrooms, courgettes and a white wine cream sauce, generously finished with chopped parsley and a handful of baby spinach gently wilted through the sauce at the end. I love cooking vegetables and sauce together like this, in a kind of ragout…I advise a generous heap to present your chicken on, and have it with a salad and some nice white wine.",

  "summary": "This is my take on a classic soup. I like to use ham hock because of the flakey texture of the meat.",
  "total_time": "PT6H",
  "introduction": "I use ham hock for my take on this classic soup; it has a flakey texture and is a bit fattier than most other cuts of ham, thereby providing more flavour. The ham hock is cooked gently in water at a barely trembling simmer for 4 hours or so, until the meat is _just_ falling off the bone. A selection of vegetables and some aromatic herbs are added for extra depth and sweetness. The resulting stock is intensely flavourful and could be served as an acceptable broth on its own, but when combined with sweet garden peas it's truly fantastic. You can use fresh peas for this, but it's much easier (and just as delicious) to use defrosted frozen ones.\r\n\r\nTo get a nice vibrant green colour, it's important to cook the peas as quickly as possible. Achieve this by ensuring the peas are fully defrosted and that the stock is boiling hot when you add it. Then, blend the soup immediately on full-power. If you're making the soup in advance and won't be eating it straight away, you should cool it down as fast as possible by transferring it to a large tray or bowl placed over an ice bath, then continuously scrape the soup away from the sides with a spatula until cold. This works better with a metal bowl or tray, since it will conduct heat better than plastic or ceramic.\r\n",

  "total_time": "PT3D",
  "introduction": "This salmon is lightly cured with salt, dill, juniper berries, black pepper and a little gin. It's pretty much a classic  _gravadlax_. Most recipes for cured salmon you'll find will tell you to leave the salmon curing for at least 48 hours – even up to several days – but I have found this to make the end product salty to the point that it is unpalatable. Instead, I leave my salmon in the cure mix for only 36 hours; wash it off then leave it on a kitchen towel on a tray in the fridge for a couple of days to dry out naturally. This final drying step is important, I think, in getting a perfectly cured texture. Assuming that the salmon was fresh before you cured it, it will keep happily in the fridge for one week.\r\n\r\nIdeally you should have two smallish roasting trays or containers that nest inside each other, for pressing the salmon as it cures. If you don't have anything suitable, you can wrap clingfilm around it and use two plates instead.",

When simply boiled, they're not great. Because they're so dense, by the time the heart is cooked the vibrant green outer leaves have turned brown and unappetising. If you remove the outer leaves and cook them separately, the hearts can be slowly braised, creating a rich sauce that will infuse flavour into the hard centres.",

  "total_time": "PT1H30M",
  "introduction": "When I lived in Sheffield I used to make this dish with my flatmates Jack and John. It’s easy to rustle up pretty quickly, and if you make your own authentic caesar dressing as we did, it’s proper and delicious too. The dressing is key to this dish; it’s a super-enriched mayonnaise, packed with powerful savouriness from garlic, parmesan, anchovies and olive oil. The richness is balanced by a vital squeeze of lemon juice. We always used chicken breast, gently baked in the oven until just cooked, but I’ve switched to using leg now as the darker flakey meat has more flavour and a more pleasing rustic feel that is nicely suited to this dish. This salad provides a fantastic interplay of textures; balancing juicy shredded chicken with crunchy fresh leaves of lettuce and crisp bacon, all bound happily together by the glossy rich dressing. Extra crunch is given by lovely golden croutons.",

  "title": "Rabbit Liver Parfait",
  "summary": "Probably the tastiest thing to do with liver",
  "total_time": "PT8H",
  "introduction": "For years of my childhood I hated eating liver. One of our regular meals at home was a bacon and tomato pasta sauce which was finished with sautéed chicken livers. I would always baulk at the livers and have just the pasta sauce instead. The flavour has grown on me recently though and I actually love it now. Strange though I have always loved liver paté. Mum always made it at Christmas time, which we’d have on toast with chutney and salad for lunch; a really nice combination. She made it by frying the liver with bacon, adding some herbs, a splash of sherry and some cream then puréeing and leaving to set in a bowl. It was a favourite and always got finished quickly.\r\n\r\nWhen I was working at Blackmore’s I got introduced to chicken liver parfait. It’s a luxurious version of paté that is enriched with eggs and butter. All the ingredients are blitzed together raw, poured into a mould and cooked very gently so that the finished article is still beautifully pink. It’s really fantastic, and easily the best way to treat livers in my opinion. My brother recently acquired 18 wild rabbits from the farm at home, brought them up to Edinburgh and put them in his freezer. I went over to his house today and got a couple to make something tasty with. I also picked up all of the livers from the rabbits which he had set aside. Rabbit liver parfait!\r\n\r\nRabbit liver has a similar consistency to chicken liver but tastes miles better. It would be perfect to make parfait with. I couldn’t find any recipes for rabbit parfait so I have used Raymond Blanc’s recipe for chicken liver parfait and adapted it slightly. I cooked it in a water bath in a cool oven to ensure that the heat transfer is gentle and we end up with a lovely pink colour. To execute this recipe properly, you will need a temperature probe, otherwise determining when the parfait is done is pretty much guess work. Because liver parfait is so rich, it needs to be garnished appropriately. Pickle or chutney is great as it has an acidic kick of vinegar which cuts through the meaty savouriness. Add some salad leaves for freshness and you have an excellent dish. Served on toast, or with delicate melba toast as I did, and you have a luxurious and delicious platter for your lunch.",

Once everything is combined, season to taste with salt and black pepper, then pass the mixture through a fine sieve.

  "summary": "I'm very proud of this recipe - it has served me well over the years",
  "total_time": "PT4H",
  "introduction": "Preserving and pickling is something that I have a great appreciation for. The beauty of preserving food is that fresh fruit and veg which is in season and plentiful can be enjoyed throughout the year when it is no longer available. Nowadays in supermarkets one can buy almost any vegetable at any time of year as food is imported from all over the world, but if you care about using seasonal and local produce, as I do, then you will also see the huge benefit in preserving.\r\nI had a recipe for this amazing red onion chutney which I thought I’d lost. The last time I made it I couldn’t find the recipe so had to improvise and, although tasty, it wasn’t as good as the original. The old recipe was an adaptation of the red onion chutney that we used to make at Blackmore’s of Alnwick, where I first worked as a chef. I changed the spices and added white wine for extra flavour. It has a fantastic rich sweetness that is hard not to adore. This chutney, as with many pickles, improves and matures with age. Ideally it should be left in the jar for at least a few months before eating. It will taste great if eaten immediately of course, but I recommend waiting. Serve this chutney with cheese and crackers, or put in a cheese and ham sandwich for an extra punch of flavour.",

  "total_time": "PT45M",
  "introduction": "Rigatoni is my favourite pasta shape. Its chunkiness appeals to me and I find that it holds a thick sauce better than many other pastas. It's particularly good when paired with a cream sauce such as this one. This recipe is almost as quick and simple as a pasta dish could be – sauteed chestnut or button mushrooms in a cream sauce with some spinach leaves thrown in at the end. And a generous grating of parmesan cheese, of course.\r\nThis time, however, I've enhanced the recipe with some of my homemade powdered chanterelles to give a boost of savouriness. This is optional, and you'll still get a tasty result without it, but it's absolutely worth it if you can find time time to dehydrate and grind some mushrooms to a powder – ideally a wild variety such as chanterelles (girolles) or ceps, or if that's not possible then shop-bought chestnut or button mushrooms will suffice to produce a tasty powder. Check out my [mushroom powder](https://www.grubdaily.com/mushroom-powder) recipe for details.",

  "total_time": "PT1H20M",
  "introduction": "Of all the curries in the world, the Vindaloo is probably the most misunderstood. It’s notorious for being extremely hot and spicy, yet a genuine vindaloo is nothing near as spicy as its reputation would suggest, as I discovered when I visited Goa; the former Portuguese colony in India that is the Vindaloo’s home. I sampled several local versions of the famous curry there, and expecting my head to be blown off with heat and spice, I was actually pleasantly surprised; these Vindaloos were only moderately spicy, but strong with garlic and also had a distinctive vinegary tang.\r\nVinegar is the key ingredient in a Vindaloo, and it’s possibly the cause of the Vindaloo’s fearsome reputation. Accidentally adding too much vinegar, and a little too much cayenne pepper, and you’ll have a concoction so eye-wateringly powerful that it’s probably not very enjoyable to eat.\r\nMadhur Jaffrey’s recipe for Vindaloo calls for duck, which is a break from tradition; the classic was typically made with pork. I have opted for chicken, and the result is excellent. This is adapted from Madhur’s recipe, although the underlying technique is hers. Afterall, she is the master of Indian cooking. Personally, I like to enjoy this with nothing more than some plain white basmati rice, although some sautéed green vegetable such as kale or chard, will go alongside nicely.",

  "introduction": "My brother-in-law Khaled is from _Ouzoud_ in Morocco, a picturesque village nestled in the foothills of the Atlas mountains. It's a beautiful part of the country; there's a magnificent waterfall, huge valleys filled with olive trees and barley, all surrounded by the red earth of the rolling hills. It's one of the loveliest, most relaxing places I've ever been to. Of course, there are some excellent things to eat here too.\r\nClearly, one of the main attractions of Morocco, for me, is the food. It's famed for the _Tagine_, the iconic red clay dish with a conical lid, and many dishes will be cooked and also served in it. This omelette was a regular brunch during our stay in Ouzoud, and I love the simplicity of it. There are a fair number of ingredients, but the process is straight forward; it's essentially a rustic, lightly spiced ragout made from peppers, tomatoes and lemon, and finished with some lightly beaten eggs. I love the addition of chopped lemon, pith and skin and all. It adds a wonderful zing and depth of flavour.\r\nYou'll need either a tagine or a heavy based frying pan with lid, measuring about 22cm in diameter.",

  "introduction": "I got the idea for this recipe when I was in India with Jack and Claire. We were in Goa and, growing tired of curry, were craving some western food for our dinner. We came upon an Italian restaurant on the edge of the beach, with plastic tables and chairs arranged under palm trees. Reputedly the pizzas and pasta were particularly good so we thought we’d give it a go. I went for ‘tomato and prawn spaghetti’ and it was absolutely delicious. It was a simple dish, using fresh tomatoes and little baby prawns. It had a really nice light sauce and was the perfect thing to eat on a hot evening, accompanied by a chilled bottle of beer! So this is my attempt at replicating that dish. It’s basically a sauce made from tomato juice, white wine and garlic, then thickened and enriched with butter. The diced tomato flesh and prawns are then simply added to heat through, just before serving. I used frozen cooked baby prawns, but if you can find fresh ones then all the better. It’s seasonal too; tomatoes are just about still good at this time of year, so make the most of it!",

  "total_time": "PT6H",
  "introduction": "For the last six months at work I’ve been on desserts, getting to grips with the complexities of sugar, caramel, chocolate and eggs in all their different forms (not to mention all the fantastic fruit and berries in season just now!). Chocolate is a steadfast ingredient in any dessert menu and quite fascinating to work with. Recently I have just learned how to temper chocolate to give it an amazingly shiny, brittle finish. It’s not the easiest thing to achieve; a precise technique that’s really satisfying when it works properly. Another thing I’ve been getting my head around is chocolate mousse; a classic dessert which is subtly difficult to perfect. I remember making it when I was young; whipped cream folded into melted chocolate, always resulting in a smooth but rather dense and rich mousse. A perfect mousse should be really light and have a true melt-in-the-mouth texture; not what I have in my memories of childhood. The lightness comes from incorporating whipped cream and whipped egg whites into the melted chocolate, but the result depends of the temperature of the chocolate; too hot and the air will collapse from the mousse; too cold and the chocolate will seize up and become grainy. This recipe works well, the secret here is to heat and whisk egg yolks with sugar and water (or coffee, as in this recipe) to create a silky light sabayon which the chocolate is then melted into. From there I add whipped cream, and lastly some soft whipped egg whites to make it extra light and aerated.",

  "introduction": "To the uninitiated, \"refried beans\" doesn't sound especially appetising. I can assure you though, this unglamorous staple from the Mexican kitchen can be deeply savoury and delicious if prepared with love and care. Refried beans can be served alongside almost any savoury meal you like, but they're particularly good with a steak, especially when combined with a fresh summery salad, as I've done here. Classic refried beans are usually cooked to a pulp and then mashed, but I like to retain some of the form of the beans, and fry them til they're nice and crisp.\r\n\r\nYou can use dried beans and soak them overnight before cooking them, and you'll get a slightly better flavour this way as you can simmer them in stock and ensure the liquid is appropriately seasoned with salt. You can, however, achieve perfectly acceptable results with canned beans. The important bit is the frying; you want to get decent caramelisation on the beans to untap their rich savouriness. Get your pan really hot, and it's important to dry the beans a bit by laying them on a tea towel or a piece of kitchen paper before cooking; it'll be much easier to get colour on them. Use any kind of beans you like; cannellini, butter, black, haricot etc.",

  "introduction": "Cauliflowers are in season and I've spent the last few weeks doing some experimentation as a way of celebrating what I think is a rather under-appreciated vegetable. A cauliflower is good for so much more than cauliflower cheese! Because it naturally has quite a savoury flavour it is good in a curry, for example _aloo gobi_, a classic Indian curry made with potatoes (aloo) and cauliflower (gobi).\r\nSo I wanted to try preparing cauliflower in the form of a vindaloo, which is (and probably always will be) my all-time favourite curry. A classic vindaloo is made with pork, but works great with chicken too, which is one of my go-to staples for a curry night with friends. A [runner bean vindaloo](https://www.grubdaily.com/runner-bean-vindaloo) was a previous late-summer experiment of mine which was a fantastic and delicious success. I think this moment was inevitable: it is now time for the cauliflower to receive the vindaloo treatment!",

  "title": "Hake with Confit Neeps and Brown Butter",
  "summary": "This is an excellent winter meal, combining a classic Scottish ingredient with fresh fish and generous amount of butter",
  "total_time": "PT1H30M",
  "introduction": "The neep, or swede, is a classic Scottish ingredient most commonly associated with _haggis neeps and tatties_, the national dish. For this famous meal it's usually blended or crushed to a pulp with butter – much the same as one would make mashed potato – and it's really nice like this; the butter compliments the sweetness of the neeps, which are surprisingly sweet when cooked. I do, however, think it's underrated as an ingredient to be used in many other ways.\r\nRestaurant Mark Greenaway, one of the places I worked, used to serve _confit neeps_. The neeps were cut into chunky oblongs and then slowly cooked in clarified butter. They were served simply with a fillet of hake topped with a herb crust. My version of hake-with-neeps is an improvement on Mark's version, I think, because I sauteed the confit neeps before serving, to bring some vital caramelisation to the party. Combined with the crunchy skin of the pan fried hake, it's pretty excellent.\r\nBasting with butter is not just a lovely way to finish cooking the fish; allowing the butter to turn nutty and brown (_beurre noisette_) gives you a deeply flavoured sauce that is almost effortless. This is a traditional way to serve fish – in fact, after I added chopped lemon and capers, this was more or less a _sauce grenobloise_, minus the croutons and with the addition of brown shrimp. Finally, to complete the garnish I added some sauteed cavolo nero, in keeping with the theme of winter vegetables. ",

  "introduction": "These little potatoey pillows are quite time consuming to make but the whole process is an absolute pleasure. And they are, of course, also a pleasure to eat. To make things easier you could just create plain pillow-shaped gnocchi, but it's nice to use a fork (or a gnocchi paddle, if you have one) to lightly press ridges onto the gnocchi after you've rolled them. They are particularly excellent when fried in a hot pan until golden and crisp, and will go nicely served with almost anything you can think of.\r\nThe best potatoes to use for gnocchi are Albert Bartlett Roosters. The texture and consistency of them is perfect – whenever we made gnocchi in the kitchen at work this is the only potato we ever used. Bake them in the oven until _just_ cooked. Be careful not to overdo them. Mashing them with a traditional masher will not suffice; you need to pass it through a sieve to get it nice and smooth. Once the dough is ready to shape you need to work quickly before it cools down otherwise the starch in the potato becomes gluey. As a general rule of thumb, have one person per potato to help with the rolling and shaping. Get your loved ones involved to help out!",

  "introduction": "This classic Italian soup is an old friend of mine. I fell in love with it when I encountered it in what is, to this day, probably still my favourite book on Italian food: [Jamie's Italy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0718147707/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=grubdaily-21&creative=6738&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0718147707&linkId=6e5861b3574225e3a1ed65b04223add7). There are no strict rules to this soup, but a proper minestrone should be seasonal; just go to the garden and pick whatever you have. If you don't have a garden, just choose what you want from the shop, but try to avoid using courgettes in the middle of winter, for example, or root vegetables like celeriac in the middle of summer.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the stock is important. Ideally, get a knuckle of gammon or ham and cook that first to obtain a rich ham stock. This is perfect for the minestrone. If this isn't possible, use a good quality rich chicken stock instead. Usually there will be some kind of beans in a minestrone, typically haricot or cannellini, but I opted for black beans because I think they're the best. You'll need to soak them in cold water for several hours beforehand, but you can substitute them for cooked ones (from a tin) if you wish.",

It's so easy to do, and much, much cheaper than buying your own.\r\nI didn't cure this one though – it was a gift from my friend Prof. He had cured a whole side and had too much to eat. I was more than happy to help him out! It was beautifully cured; not too salty which home-cured products often are. If you contact him on [his instagram](https://www.instagram.com/grapeman_euan/), maybe he'll give you the recipe.\r\nFor this dish, I'll assume you have sourced your own cured salmon from somewhere. If you can't find beetroot cured salmon then gravlax or smoked salmon will suffice.",

  "total_time": "PT1H",
  "introduction": "This mushrooming season was all about girolles, which was delightful, but I was slightly disappointed not to find more ceps. I probably got about 20 in total of varying sizes. I [made powder](https://www.grubdaily.com/mushroom-powder) with the larger ones and used the others in various recipes. One of the simplest and nicest things to do with a small firm cep is to roast it until caramelised and serve it with a soft boiled egg. This is especially lovely when accompanied by some crunchy sourdough toast.\r\nIn the restaurant where I used to work, by mid-August when cep season was in full swing, we would typically serve them with scallops, lamb or even lobster. The cep would be sliced in half down the centre before being roasted in a hot pan in duck fat; a decadent technique originally pioneered by Pierre Koffmann, the boldest of the old school French chefs. Once a good caramelisation was achieved, it would be flipped on its back and put in a hot oven for a few minutes. Served with a rich cep puree, it was a special dish.\r\nMy version is a bit simpler and does not involve duck fat. I don't use the oven either (as long as the cep is smallish), preferring to baste it in butter after caramelising in hot rapeseed oil. Basting it carefully until it's cooked results in additional caramelisation and the butter turns nutty and brown and provides a simple sauce to drizzle over.",

  "introduction": "For me, tomatoes are the highlight of summer. They are best, at their sweetest and juiciest, during the peak of the season, from June through to August. Panzanella is an old-school Italian peasant dish, a spectacular combination of leftover scraps of stale bread and fresh, ripe tomatoes. Although probably classed as a salad, this amazing plate of food is, for me, often a meal in its own right.\r\nThe quality of bread is important; you want a crusty sourdough with big air pockets. Tear it into bite-sized chunks and leave them uncovered to go stale for a few days. They should be as hard as possible. The rest of the dish is based around a simple dressing made from the juice of the tomatoes: cut them into chunky pieces, season with sea salt and leave in a colander for 20 minutes. Squeezing them out with your hands releases the juices and you simply add vinegar and extra virgin olive oil to make a sharp, powerful dressing. The stale bread is then added to this to soak up all the flavour. It's amazing.",

  "total_time": "PT1D",
  "introduction": "It has been a very successful mushrooming season so far, and I am now overrun with girolles. I have almost more than I know what to do with. To be honest, it's a nice problem to have! I could probably use them in about two weeks by eating them in various guises for breakfast, lunch _and_ dinner, but it would feel like a bit of a waste... I would like to extend the joy of eating these delicious mushrooms for as long as possible.\r\nSo I started researching different methods of preserving mushrooms. Drying was an obvious one: I oven-dried most of the scruffy ones and made powder from them; an intensely flavoured seasoning that's worth its weight in gold. Pickling is a popular method for preserving various vegetables, but it's not commonly applied to mushrooms. I gave it a go, and the result was pretty good. I didn't add salt to the pickling liquid as I feared it would break down the flesh of the mushroom too much, so the final product requires a sprinkling of sea salt to bring out the flavour properly.\r\nI won't lie to you, these pickled mushrooms are quite intense and vinegary and are best enjoyed as an accompaniment to something else. They would be sublime in a bacon sandwich or a burger. You could even incorporate them into a salad. There are many possibilities. I advise using girolles for this, if you can source them, but it would work just as well with button mushrooms or chestnut mushrooms from the supermarket.",

  "total_time": "PT10H",
  "introduction": "This is an excellent way to prepare chicken legs, and although it takes a bit of finesse to do it properly, it's absolutely worth the effort. I debone the whole chicken leg in one piece, the drumstick and thigh together, being careful not to make any holes in the skin. I then sprinkle some rock salt on the skin-side of the legs, a marinade of paprika, garlic and olive oil on the flesh side, and place them in the fridge for around 6 hours. This curing of the skin makes it fantastically crisp when fried in a hot pan.\r\nThe garnish for this meal was, as is often the case for my weeknight meals, a combination of whatever I could find in my fridge. Button mushrooms, Jersey Royal potatoes and creme fraiche seemed like they would go together well, and I threw some fine quality Hungarian paprika into the mix too, for an extra punch of flavour and a vital bit of colour. Some crisp fried parsley leaves as a garnish, and the result was a delicious (and eye-catching) plate of food.",

  "introduction": "If you know what you're looking for, you can find edible mushrooms in the wild most of the year, not only the autumn months (in which they are certainly more abundant). My favourites; namely _girolles_ (also known as _chanterelles_) and _ceps_, don't usually come fully into season until late summer, depending on the conditions. Girolles invariably come before ceps, and in Scotland you can often find them as early as June. Perthshire in particular, is well known in local culinary circles as a mushroom haven.\r\nSo, although wild mushrooms are typically associated with autumn, the prime season for girolles is mid-to-late summer, and will continue into the autumn. If you get them while they're young and small, they're like delicate yellow buttons and make for a beautiful plate of food. I picked these last weekend in a local spot that has a reliable crop every year, and I was wondering what to do with them. Garlic mushrooms on toast is really hard to beat, so here it is.",

  "title": "Cured Salmon and Jersey Royals",
  "summary": "This is a wonderful summery dish to make with home-cured salmon",
  "total_time": "PT3D",
  "introduction": "Everyone knows that fish is best enjoyed as fresh as possible, so if you've bought some fresh fish on your weekly shopping trip, you ought to eat it within the first two days, ideally. There's another solution though, which may not seem obvious. You can easily salt the fish to cure it, which extends its shelf life considerably. As a bonus, it also improves the texture and flavour. In my opinion, salting fish is a no-brainer. An old chef friend of mine, Hearty, is also a firm advocate of salting fish before cooking it. Often, he's not salting it for as much as a day or more to properly \"cure\" it, but completely covering it in salt for just 20 or 30 minutes, which has the effect of firming up the fish and makes the skin extra crisp when fried in a hot pan. Curing it for longer, though, will preserve the fish for longer and allow you to continue enjoying it for several days.\r\nHere I have made a herb-cured salmon, sort of a simple version of Swedish gravlax. The recipe combines the salmon with a wonderful combination of Jersey Royal potatoes (for me, one of the seasonal highlights of the year), basil and lemon. It's a lovely light summer meal. The curing takes between 48 and 72 hours, and will then store in the fridge happily for up to a week. This process works better with large pieces of fish rather than small fillets, so you will end up with more than you need for the dish. You can keep the extra in the fridge for another meal, or freeze it.",

  "summary": "An interesting take on the classic Italian dish",
  "total_time": "PT30M",
  "introduction": "While this lockdown is still in place I'm working on the theme of tinned fish. Previously, I pointed out how well mackerel works as a preserved, tinned product. Part of the reason for this is that it's a particularly oily fish and it doesn't tend to be dry when cooked. It's also one of the most abundant fish in the ocean – especially around the british isles – so it's sustainable. Another fish which ticks these boxes is anchovies. Anchovies are one of the most abundant fish in the entire world. For sustainability points, they are hard to beat. They are also, of course, really really tasty.\r\nThis recipe combines two things I've always been very fond of: 1) pasta, and 2) bold, powerful flavours. pasta puttanesca combines these in glorious fashion, so it's no surprise that it makes it to my list of all time favourite pasta dishes.\r\nTechnically, this recipe isn't really a true puttanesca (Check out my [previous post](https://www.grubdaily.com/pasta_puttanesca) for  a more traditional recipe). This is a bastardized version of sorts, where tomatoes have been switched for spinach. So we have a combination of spinach, anchovies and garlic, which is nothing new; these ingredients would be excellent partners to a roast leg of lamb, for example. The addition of two different types of chilli flakes, including smoky chipotle, makes for a really powerful flavour combination.",

  "title": "Lamb Chops with Spinach and Croutons",
  "summary": "An excellent way to serve lamb chops that doesn't risk overcooking the tender loin meat",
  "total_time": "PT1H",
  "introduction": "Lamb chops are great, but admittedly they're not my favourite cut of lamb. Each lamb chop consists of a cutlet from the loin attached to its corresponding rib bone, usually with a gorgeous thick slab of back fat along the bone. Its _bovine_ equivalent is the celebrated and iconic beef rib roast. The loin, regardless of which animal it's from, is one of the tenderest and most prized cuts of meat around and I think it's a bit of a shame to prepare a loin of lamb as chops because they're hard to cook; you have to roast them with enough ferocity to get the fat nice and crisp without overcooking the meat. Because there's usually a large amount of fat this is virtually impossible. In my opinion, you'd be better to ask your butcher for a full rack of chops (cutlets) to roast whole or even take the loin completely off the bone before roasting like a steak. Both of these methods allow you to keep the meat nice and pink, which is how it is supposed to be.\r\nTo avoid this difficult situation I deboned the chops and left the meat as medallion-sized chunks. The fat, which is full of flavour and a _key_ part of this dish, I diced into 1cm chunks. I seasoned everything with crunchy sea salt and a little sprinkling of white pepper before searing in a very hot pan. The rest of the dish comprised some chunky croutons, made from my numerous leftover sourdough loaves, sautéed spinach and some anchovy fillets. Seasoned generously with cracked black pepper, sea salt and a splash of tarragon vinegar, it was very, very good.",

The jet-black of the squid ink is pretty amazing, especially when it's contrasted with the white sauteed squid on top, which is nicely scored in a criss-cross pattern and finished with a pinch of persillade, which adds a nice hint of green. It's a good-looking dish, that's undeniable, but it also tastes great too of course!\r\nAsk your fishmonger to separate the squid bodies and tentacles. The tentacles are great fried whole until they're crisp and they are perfect for garnishing the top of the risotto with, but I also like to chop some of them into small pieces and put them in the _soffrito_ with the shallots and garlic. If you fry them in a hot pan until they're caramelised and sticky, this gives a powerful savoury base for the risotto.\r\nEven if the squid has been cleaned and prepped beforehand, scoring the bodies properly is a bit time consuming and requires some finesse to get it right. It's worth making the effort to make it nice though.",

Place each one on the chopping board, _soft side down_ and trim the edges so until uniformly smooth and use the knife to scrape any stray bits of membrane off. You want to score the soft side of the squid in lines about 3mm apart, but you should be careful not to cut all the way through. It's actually easier if you're knife isn't very sharp. Once all the squid is scored, store it on a kitchen towel or j-cloth and set aside.",

  "introduction": "A few years ago I posted recipe for confit chicken served with lemon dressing and pak choi. It was an adaptation of a home classic my mum makes on a regular basis, and the original dish, or a version close to it, is  one of my go-to regular meals. This is a quicker and simpler version using coriander  - both seeds and leaves - and it's absolutely tasty.\r\nIt's ready in less than an hour, so is a pretty good option for a quick weeknight dinner. The basic process is very simple: one chicken leg per person, fried in a pan until golden, then oven-roasted in the same pan with coriander, lemon, shallots and a little water. 30-40 minutes later and you've got chicken with golden crunchy skin, and a naturally rich sauce that's packed full of flavour. It's wonderful served with wilted greens and boiled new potatoes.\r\nI have a cast-iron skillet that's perfect for this. Any oven-safe frying pan will do though, or even a casserole dish. The dish should be big enough to comfortably fit the chicken legs in one layer.",

I had three of them in my fruit bowl this morning and they were at an advanced  stage of ripeness; way past speckly-brown, they were _completely_ black, and were beginning to go moldy on the outside. I was about to throw them in the bin, but out of curiosity I peeled one open to have a look, and it seemed fine, if a bit sticky and caramelised. They would be perfect for banana bread.\r\nI'm quite particular when it comes to bananas as a snack; for me, they must be only just ripe; the greenness gone but still slightly firm inside. That's a perfect banana. When a banana passes this stage, I'm pretty disinclined to peel it open for a snack. I think subconsciously I know I can make banana bread if I wait for it to go soft sticky, and overripe fruit, and it doesn't have to go to waste! I'll admit; I actually prefer banana bread to a banana on its own. It's not quite as healthy, I know, but that's rarely a priority for me. It _tastes_ better, and that's what really counts.",

  "title": "Runner Bean Vindaloo",
  "summary": "An unconventional but delicious way to prepare runner beans",
  "total_time": "PT1H",
  "introduction": "Last month I made the annual end-of-summer visit to my parents' farm. This is a particularly opportune time of year to visit as there is a huge _glut_ of produce coming from the garden (and mushrooms from the woods, but that is a story for another time). I left with an overflowing box full of tomatoes, sweetcorn, apples, peas, broad beans, a _massive_ quantity of courgettes, cucumbers, runner beans and fresh herbs. I took as much as I could carry.\r\nIn previous years I would hesitate before taking the runner beans. I have to admit, until recently I was always a bit unenthusiastic when it came to runner beans. I think it was their slightly furry texture that put me off. However, my mum used to make this unusual but very delicious green bean chutney which I loved; rich with mustard seeds and onions and turmeric, it had a curry-like aspect to it which, as a long-time curry lover, obviously appealed to me. Last year I had about half a kilo of runner beans and, wondering what to do with them, I remembered this chutney, and so got mum to send me the recipe. It is, as you'd expect of any good chutney, quite vinegary, which is another thing that particularly gets my taste-buds going! The chutney was great, and was just as tasty as in my memories.\r\nThis recipe is _not_ for a chutney, but it was the seed of an idea. I had a moment of inspiration and realised that I could make a hot version of the runner bean chutney which, with generous quantities of vinegar and garlic, would be kinda like a _vindaloo_. It turned out to be really good, I'll definitely be making it again and I'll be pre-ordering the runner beans from the garden next year! ",

I like pheasant but it has one drawback; it's easy to overcook and can be quite dry if you're not careful. To counteract this tendency to dryness I cooked them carefully in butter at a fairly low temperature, almost like a _confit_, and served them with a generous amount of bright yellow rapeseed dressing which is pretty much just a light mayonnaise.\r\nAs is always the case in my kitchen, I had a pile of sourdough bread scraps to use up. They were crying out to me made into croutons and this provided the perfect addition to the dish, bringing a vital texture contrast. Cutting the still-warm pheasant into chunky dice, with a little pinkness showing, and the croutons cut the same size, I was happy with the result.",

  "introduction": "One of my favourite ways to cook potatoes is what we used to call _fondants_ (although I'm not sure this is technically the correct term), where you cut them in half and place the flat side down in a wide frying pan, then half cover with water, add butter and seasoning and then loosely cover with foil. You then boil the water until the potatoes are cooked, at which point you remove the foil and continue to cook them until they're golden and roasted on the bottom.\r\nIt's a great way to cook any kind of root vegetable because any flavour that is drawn out of the vegetable during the cooking process isn't lost; the liquid is reduced down to coat the bottom of the vegetable as it caramelises. I wanted to try the same technique with cauliflower, because it has such an attractive shape when you cut it directly through the middle of the stem. It looks great, and is delicious too.\r\nThe puree is surprisingly simple: just the trimmings from the cauliflower, rapeseed oil, salt and water. Cauliflower puree is traditionally made with milk, butter or cream and as a result is pretty rich and heavy. This one is amazingly light. This can also be a fantastic vegan dish - just substitute the butter for rapeseed oil.",

Get a heavy, wide-based pot or deep saute pan, add 3 tablespoons of rapeseed oil and place over a medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the chopped cauliflower and a generous pinch of salt. Boil the kettle so you have some hot water at hand. Saute the cauliflower, stirring frequently, for about 5-10 minutes. You want to fry the cauliflower as hot as you can (without getting any colour on it), to draw maximum flavour from it. When it's almost cooked, add enough water to half-cover, then boil until it's completely dry. Repeat this 3 times. After the third reduction, add enough water to loosen the cauliflower and pour it all into a blender. Blend on full power, adding a little more water if it's too thick, for about 3 minutes or until completely smooth. Taste, and add more salt if necessary.",

  "summary": "This is quite a bit of effort for a loaf of bread, but trust me, it’s worth it.",
  "total_time": "PT2D",
  "introduction": "I got hooked on making my own bread after visiting my aunt who makes award winning sourdough loaves. She donated me a small sample of her starter dough, which I brought home and cultured until it had grown to a decent enough size for me to begin making my own crunchy, tangy loaves. Although this is not a sourdough recipe, I feel obliged to mention my aunt as it was the impressive texture and flavour of her sourdough bread that convinced me to start making my own every day.\r\nAll the best bread begins with a starter. This is either a sourdough starter (_levain_), or a _poolish_, which is a 50-50 mixture of flour and water with a small amount of yeast that’s left for about 1 day to ferment before adding more flour, yeast and water to create the actual dough. Using a starter will create a superior texture and give the bread more depth of flavour. A mature sourdough starter will give you more flavour and texture, but fact that the _poolish_ only requires 1 day of planning (compared to 1 week or more with the sourdough) makes it an attractive option.\r\nThe basis of this recipe is similar to that found in Thomas Keller’s Bouchon Bakery. I have simplified the method to make it a _little_ less labour intensive. It’s a compromise; the outcome of Keller’s recipe _is_ slightly superior, although not by much! This recipe is quicker and easier, and pretty-much-as-good as Keller’s. It’s still quite a bit of effort for a loaf of bread, but trust me, it’s worth it. I have added bacon and comté cheese, along with some rich tasting rapeseed oil; this is a luxurious treat.\r\nThe vital crunchy crust is achieved firstly by having a _really_ hot oven before you put the bread in; secondly by scoring the bread, either down the center, across in stripes or a random pattern, with a sharp knife just before putting in the oven; and lastly by throwing a mugful of water into the bottom of the oven just before you close the door.\r\nFor the final shaping and proving of the bread, you’ll need a baker’s linen cloth, or (like me) you can simply use a heavy-ish tea-towel instead. Also, a wide, flat baking sheet or stone is needed.",

  "total_time": "PT2H",
  "introduction": "This is another one for all the peanut butter lovers out there, and in fact I’d be willing to bet that even peanut butter haters will enjoy this dessert. There’s something about the flavour and texture of peanut butter that makes it quite uncompromising; for some, the richness is too much on its own, and is only palatable when paired with something sweet. In the contest to be the most loved peanut butter dish, the old-school favourite _peanut butter and jam_ is arguably winning. I would, however, argue that this cheesecake beats it hands-down.\r\nBroadly speaking, there are two classes of cheesecake: baked, and unbaked. This one falls into the latter (slightly quicker and easier) option. The general technique for the filling is very simple; make a thick puree (peanut caramel in this case, although strawberry, raspberry or chocolate also work well), and mix in cream cheese. Now simply soft-peak-whip some cream and gently fold in.\r\nThis cheesecake is mousse-like in texture and rich in taste. The biscuit base provides a nice contrast to the creamy-cheesy peanut mix that sits atop. Traditionally, Digestive biscuits have been used for a cheesecake base, but why use Digestives when you could use Hobnobs instead? After all, they taste better and it’s what [Delia](https://www.deliaonline.com/) would do.",

  "summary": "This is a lovely way to serve ricotta. It's better to make your own as it will be firmer and easier to form into balls.",
  "total_time": "PT4H",
  "introduction": "A while ago I decided to try my hand at cheesemaking - as a devoted lover of cheese I think it was inevitable that I would try to make my own sooner or later. The obvious starting point for any amateur cheesemaker is ricotta. It's the simplest of cheeses - simply add something acidic, such as lemon juice, to some milk to split it into its constituent parts, and drain. Season the resulting drained curds with some sea salt and you're done; it's that easy. The nice thing about ricotta is that it's typically made with either lemon juice or vinegar, rather than rennet like most other cheeses, so you don't need any specialist ingredients.\r\nThis dish was inspired by a recipe for a Corsican/Italian dish called _strozapretti_, which consists of rustic ricotta dumplings loaded with chopped fresh herbs and chard. It's like ravioli but without the pasta. Normally, the dumplings would be fairly rough and imperfect in shape, but I have shaped mine nicely into rounds. I've also baked them in the oven until golden, which is great with the grated parmesan on top.  Baked in a rich tomato sauce, it's pretty irresistible!\r\nThe ricotta for this recipe should be quite firm, which is easy to achieve if you make your own. Click [here](https://www.grubdaily.com/ricotta) for my own ricotta recipe. Alternatively, you can use shop-bought ricotta and drain it overnight in a fine sieve.",

  "summary": "Homemade bacon is truly wonderful, I encourage everyone to try it",
  "total_time": "PT5D",
  "introduction": "Since my last batch of dry cure bacon had been finished up a while ago, it was high time I made some more. Although I was pleased with the last lot, I was slightly annoyed by the fact I had to soak it in water to reduce the saltiness, as the flavour from the rosemary, sugar and black peppercorns will have also been reduced. Whilst browsing the River Cottage forums one day, I read about other people who had had the same problem when following Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall’s recipe for dry cure bacon. There was one person, Howard, who had done alot of research and looked at several different recipes before he tried curing his bacon, and said it turned out beautifully. So I decided to follow his guidelines.\r\nI love making bacon. Such a simple procedure, with such amazing results. It’s quite comforting to have a load of delicious streaky bacon sitting in my fridge, waiting to be turned into something tasty. Again, I got a hold of a whole pork belly (I don’t like to do things by half), but it wasn’t all for me; the other chefs Marc, Marcus and Alan from work were going to split the cost with me for a piece of bacony loveliness.\r\nI was more adventurous with the flavourings this time; nutmeg and rosemary were the primary notes, with undertones from a few other spices also coming through. I did actually end up soaking the bacon, but only for 1 hour this time, so the extra flavours were still noticeable in the finished bacon. I didn’t manage to get a hold of any salt petre unfortunately, so the bacon won’t keep its pinkness when cooked. The flavour will be unaffected though, which is the main thing. I’m very happy with the end product; I have delicious things in store for it. It was a source of comfort and joy to have my bacon hanging up in the kitchen, slowly maturing and increasing in firmness and flavour. Everyone should try making bacon, it’s so easy, and you will have a product which is many miles better than anything you can get in a supermarket.",

  "introduction": "My mum makes excellent millionaire shortbread. It’s a treat when she comes to visit because I always get a tin full of lovely caramely chocolatey shortbread squares. On a daily basis I’ll come home from work and, hungry, peruse the fridge for something to eat. The tin of shortbread generally gets raided whilst I’m deciding what to make for my dinner…just one piece usually ends up being two or three; needless to say the millionaire shortbread supply never lasts long! Since peanut butter and chocolate is already established as a good flavour combination it was just a small logical step to make peanut butter millionaire shortbread. I’ve been doing blog posts on Scottish ingredients and recipes, and shortbread is definitely a Scottish thing so I suppose at a stretch this is a Scottish recipe. On flicking through my recipe books, I picked up some tips on how to make shortbread. Although simple, it’s important to make it carefully so as not to end up with a poor result. When mixing the ingredients it’s vital to not overwork as the butter will begin to melt; then when it cooks it’ll be hard instead of the soft, melt-in-the-mouth consistency you’re looking for. Marcus Wareing suggests finely grating the chilled butter when making shortbread, then you hardly have to work the mixture with your hands and the butter barely softens at all. The result is excellent.",

  "title": "Shepherd's Pie",
  "summary": "This dish is a true British classic",
  "total_time": "PT4H",
  "introduction": "Here’s another classic to add to the collection. It seems pretty appropriate that shepherd’s pie was a staple dish for us, at home on a sheep farm in rural Northumberland. I think this dish was traditionally made with left over meat from a roast dinner, but my Mum usually made it with our own lamb or mutton mince, which was a bit fattier than shop-bought mince and stronger in flavour; it was always really rich and filling. I’ve adapted the recipe here; instead of mince I’m using neck and slowly braising it on the bone. The neck is a pretty tough cut of meat so it needs cooking for a long time. It's more flavoursome than the prime cuts, however, and absolutely worth the wait. Lamb neck is probably the tastiest part of the animal in my view, and very underrated.\r\nIn the kitchen at work, we use veal stock as a base for most of our sauces; for something like this shepherd’s pie for example, we would make a rich jus from reduced veal stock to mix with the filling instead of gravy. The veal bones are slowly simmered in water for 2-3 days in order to extract maximum flavour and body from them. The gelatine extracted from the bones thickens the stock when it is reduced, so you get a naturally thick, rich jus without using flour. This is impractical to do at home, but you can get some way towards a proper jus when making a dish like this by cooking the meat on the bone, or adding extra bones to the braising liquid even. After reducing, the resulting sauce will be richer and have much more body to it.",

Remove from oven, cut in half and press the potato through a sieve into a wide-based saucepan. Now gradually add the butter whilst beating over a medium heat. The butter will emulsify into the dry, floury potato and give a luxurious silky texture. Add a splash of milk and mix thoroughly. Season generously with sea salt.

Fry the carrots in olive oil over a medium flame until lightly coloured. Cut the leek into 1cm squares and add to the pan. When the leeks are half-cooked, add the lamb and the sauce and gently fold, being careful not to break up the meat too much.

  "summary": "For many of us, this is an old time favourite",
  "total_time": "PT4H",
  "introduction": "This has long been a staple dish in my repertoire and I think that I, like many of us, have a weakness for a good meaty pasta sauce. However, bolognese sauce can often turn out mediocre if thrown together in a hurry and without much thought. My philosophy for making a good bolognese rests on two principles. One: it should be really meaty, and two: it should simmer gently for a long time to tenderise the meat. My usual bolognese contains beef mince, pork mince, bacon, and pork sausage meat. This gives a nice combination of meaty flavours. It’s nice to vary things though, and I sometimes combine the beef mince with lamb or venison mince. Another thing about my bolognese, which is slightly controversial, is that I omit tomatoes and only include tomato purée. The main liquid component of the sauce instead comes from beef or pork stock, which promotes a richer meat flavour. This is an easy reliable meal, and a great one to serve if you have guests since just about everyone likes spaghetti bolognese! I usually make a big quantity, then freeze most of it before adding the cream.",

Add to pan with the bacon just as it is starting to colour. Turn the heat down and simmer gently for 15-20 minutes, until the onions are soft and translucent. Peel and chop the carrots into small dice and add to the pan. Cook for a further 5 minutes. Now add the rest of the meat and turn the heat up; stir constantly until all the meat is browned and well mixed. Add the tomato purée, wine and stock, along with a good pinch of cracked black pepper, the thyme and bay leaf. Bring to the boil, then leave barely simmering, uncovered, for about 2 hours, or until the mince is very tender and the sauce is intense and rich. If need be, add more stock if the sauce is looking too dry. Taste, and season. Just before serving, stir in the double cream. Serve with grated Parmesan cheese and a nice big fresh salad.",

  "introduction": "When I was in Vietnam I fell in love with _pho_, the “noodle soup that build a nation”; eaten for breakfast, lunch and dinner and sold in hundreds of makeshift street stalls on virtually every corner in Hanoi, the nation’s bustling capital. We would perch on tiny plastic stools with soup and chopsticks in hand, slurping down the powerful broth while millions of motorbikes provided a symphony of background humming. The most common, and best, was _pho bo_, rich dark beef stock laden with strips of tender meat and tendons of beef, fragrant spices and light noodles. There was always a basket of bright leaves served alongside, herb-like greens which, when torn in rustic pieces into the bowl gave the perfect balance of freshness to the meaty soup.\r\nThis is my own, slightly simpler version of noodle broth. Although it doesn’t compare to proper Vietnamese pho it’s a reasonable substitute! To make this recipe you will need to invest some time in making proper beef stock. This takes at least eight hours of gentle simmering and I urge you to do this; the resulting flavour will be far superior than any shop-bought alternative. I haven’t added any actual meat to the soup as I reckoned there is enough flavour from the stock alone, but feel free to add some strips of cooked beef if you wish.",

  "introduction": "It’s been too long since I posted anything on here, I have been a bit preoccupied lately with finding a new home. Now settled in and enjoying the comforts of a nice flat with a better equipped kitchen than the last one (the kitchen is, after all, the most important room in any house) I am set to get blogging again. I’m very aware that there’s a lack of sweet things on this blog. I must make amends. Also, I had an idea to do a series of recipes involving quintessential Scottish ingredients…such as raspberries! This is a replication of the brownies that Marc made at Wedgwood last week; I used Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall’s basic brownie recipe as a basis. For chocoholics this is a truly indulgent affair, and combined with a gorge of fresh summer fruit in the form of juicy raspberries it’s brilliant. A fantastic marriage of flavours. The brownie should be shiny and cracked on top, hiding the heavenly soft centre which any brownie lover craves.",

  "introduction": "I think it’s high time I put a recipe for duck up here. This bird is rich in taste, tender in texture and a deep red colour; winning attributes I’m sure you’ll agree. In the restaurant at work we have made duck confit, pan fried breast (cooked pink and juicy), terrine and _rillettes_. I also made some duck ham at home which was delicious. Duck’s versatility speaks for itself; there are a myriad different ways to prepare it. The best thing about it though is the thick layer of insulating fat under its skin which keeps the animal warm in freezing cold weather. For chefs this is the most indispensable part of the animal; the fat melts during cooking, keeping the meat beautifully moist and succulent. Excess fat collects in the bottom of the roasting tray but should never be thrown away! This is essential for your confit. This method of cooking meat was originally used for preservation, a form of charcuterie. Meat that had been lightly cured, then slowly and gently cooked in its own fat was then left to cool, the fat setting around the meat, completely sealing it from any moisture or bacteria from the air. When left for 5-6 months in a cool larder, the flavours had matured, resulting in a true authentic confit. It is not essential to mature your confit for quite this long; a fantastic flavour is still achievable in a few days\r\n",

  "introduction": "Pancakes are great. When I was little I always looked forward to Shrove Tuesday because it was pancake day! Dinner consisted of as many pancakes as you could possibly eat, accompanied by a variety of fillings. The most popular, and an all-time classic was sugar and lemon juice. Simple and delicious; hard to beat. Other household favourites were bolognese sauce; maple syrup; and – I think it deserves a mention, although I realise that this will cause severe discontent among some – Marmite. “crazy talk!” I hear you say, but if you (like me) are not a hater but a lover, put some Marmite on your pancake along with some butter, it’s fantastic. The final addition to my list of classic and favourite fillings is a relatively new one for me. My friend Richard, a fellow pancake obsessive, is an advocate for butter and sugar being the all-time best pancake filler. I was surprised that I had never before thought of this combination, they are two ingredients that almost everyone is bound to have in their house, and it’s a winner. So if you make pancakes you must try it.\r\nMake sure you use plenty of butter; fry the pancake in butter and put more butter on after flipping and before adding plenty of granulated sugar. Sweet buttery goodness. Today I decided to have a break from tradition and try some new fillings. I found in my fridge some smoked salmon, crème fraîche and spinach… very soon I had two delicious pancake fillings ready to be married in tasty happiness to some beautiful crêpes.",

  "introduction": "I had some leftover raspberry purée from when I made the [chocolate and raspberry brownies](https://www.grubdaily.com/chocolate-raspberry-brownies), so I decided to turn it into cordial. My mum makes blackcurrant cordial from hoards of blackcurrant bushes we have back home and it’s fantastic. She puts it in empty Ribena bottles and it’s indistinguishable from the genuine article! I’ve always loved Ribena, and although blackcurrant cordial is quite readily available I’ve never come across a raspberry version. So here it is; the sweet taste of summer in a bottle.\r\nA basic fruit cordial consists of fruit, sugar and water. My first attempt was simply to make a sugar syrup, add the raspberry purée and bring to the boil. The result was excellent, yielding a really fresh raspberry flavour. When I subsequently did some research online, I found that most of the recipes for fruit cordial involved heating the sugar water and fruit together and simmering for 10 minutes or so before allowing to cool and bottling. I tried a second batch using this method, also adding some lemon juice and peel for a extra dimension in flavour, and although the flavour was good it was not as fresh as the first method which didn’t involve cooking the fruit for as long. In addition I think it tasted better without the lemon; I believe the amazing flavour of fresh raspberries should be allowed to shine without hindrance. This is simple, unadorned raspberry flavour!",

The sumptuous oily flesh is offset perfectly by the vinegary tang of the sauce.

Separate the milk solids from the clear stuff and set aside in a warm place. Whisk the yolks in a bowl with 1 tablespoon of your reduced vinegar over a large pan of simmering water until it's very thick, but be careful not to scramble the eggs. Now take it off the heat and gradually whisk in the clarified butter. Finally, add some salt to taste along with some freshly squeezed lemon juice, and more vinegar reduction if needed.",

  "title": "Crab Salad",
  "summary": "Crab is surely one of the tastiest things to be found in the sea",
  "total_time": "PT12H",
  "introduction": "Of all the delicious things in the world to eat, crab is easily one of my favourites. It's got an intense flavour of the sea and it's succulent, sweet and juicy. In short, it's fantastic. Preparing crab involves a bit of work and is fairly time consuming... but it's a labour of love and something I'd urge everyone to try. Cooked in generously seasoned water, the beautiful white meat is excellent whilst still warm, eaten straight from the shell. It hardly needs anything more, although mix it with a little mayonnaise, herbs and lemon juice and you have the beginnings of a delicious salad. I've been wanting to write a crab recipe for a while now, but found it difficult to think of a really photogenic looking dish that wasn't just a rip-off from one of the restaurants I've worked in. The custard part of this dish is similar to a crab crème brûlée that we did at Wedgwood, and it's really tasty. The sweet flavour of crab infuses really well in cream, and the fresh herbs added at the end finish it off beautifully.",

  "introduction": "I have a wonderful book called Jerusalem by Yottam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi. Kind of an ode to their home city, it’s filled with stories and delicious recipes. I like middle eastern food because for me it strikes a perfect balance between the heavily spiced dishes of the subcontinent further east, and the simpler, more fresh cuisine found in the mediterranean to the west. Jerusalem is an ancient city with a turbulent history; having been besieged, conquered and captured countless times. As a result it’s a city of many varying cultures, religions and traditions, and the food of Jerusalem reflects this diversity.\r\nHummus is a big thing in the middle east, especially in Jerusalem, and unsurprisingly there is an endless debate from opposing cultures about how it should be prepared; warm or cold… smooth and creamy or rustic and chunky. And which spices or garnishes to accompany it, if any at all. Most of the hummus I have had from the shops here in the UK have been almost smooth with a slight grainy texture to them. This recipe from Ottolenghi is really smooth and creamy, and much lighter in colour than hummus I’ve had before. It’s opened my eyes to how great hummus can be… I definitely recommend you try it! I made it into a light lunch by simply garnishing it with a pile of chopped coriander, tomatoes, pine nuts and olive oil. I devoured it with some fresh toasted pitta bread. Fantastic.",

  "total_time": "PT1H30M",
  "introduction": "The risotto is one of my favourite comfort foods. I've become very fond of this classic dish over the years, possibly because it's a fairly quick, easy meal that can be rustled up at a moment's notice. A plain _risotto bianco_ is hard to beat I reckon, especially when served alongside a simple green salad and a glass of crisp white wine. And it only takes a little more than 30 minutes from start to finish. This risotto is a little more involved, however. It's a proper winter dish, making good use of _cavolo nero_, that classic vegetable so loved by the Italians, and tough winter herbs thyme and rosemary to give a depth of earthiness.\r\nCavolo nero has wonderful textured leaves that are strikingly dark green, hence its English name 'black kale'. The more nutrition-conscious out there will know of its status as a superfood, but it's also got an intense savouriness that goes perfectly with something bold like a risotto. I fried some in hot oil until crispy, and sprinkled it with sea salt. A perfect garnish for the risotto as it adds a nice bit of texture. Be careful when frying it though because it will sizzle violently!\r\nFor this recipe you'll need 3 pots; one for the risotto, one for the chicken stock and one for the fried cavolo nero. If you're organised though you could fry the cavolo nero beforehand and wash the pot.",

    "description": "Pick the leaves from the thyme, being careful to leave behind the woody stalks. Place them in a bowl, then pick the leaves from the rosemary, and chop them finely. Line up the long rosemary stalks in batches, which makes for easier chopping. Add to the bowl with the thyme. You should have approx 2 full tablespoons of chopped/picked herbs. Remove the tough central stalks from the cavolo nero leaves. Take approximately a third of the leaves and cut them into roughly squares. Roughly chop the rest of it into small shreds. Bring the chicken stock to the boil. Make sure your garlic and onion are finely chopped, ready to go.",

Turn the heat to medium-high and continue to stir until all the liquid has gone. From this point the risotto will take about 15 minutes. Set a timer for 10 minutes, which is when we'll add the shredded cavolo nero and herbs. Continue to add the chicken stock, 1 ladleful at  time, stirring continuously to massage and coax the starch from the rice. This creates the heavenly unctuous sauce of the risotto. When the timer goes off, add the shredded cavolo nero and herbs. Stir, and continue cooking.",

Turn the heat off, then add the chilled butter and parmesan gradually, whilst beating the risotto to emulsify it into a lovely creamy texture. If it seems too thick, add a bit of stock.

  "introduction": "This soup is the perfect form of resistance against the bitter coldness of midwinter, it'll both warm you up and warm the cockles of your heart. There's just a hint of spice to provide a little heat, but feel free ramp it up by adding more chillies. Personally I like it nice and spicy, and will sometimes add a few drops of Tabasco sauce just before serving.\r\n\r\nThe soup starts with a _soffrito_ – onions and garlic cooked softly and gently for about 10 minutes. This gives a platform of sweetness for the rest of the ingredients to stand upon. It pays to fry the parsnips along with the spices in foaming butter at a high temperature before adding any liquid. This will generate some essential caramelisation which adds depth of flavour.",
